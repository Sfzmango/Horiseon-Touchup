## <ins> Description of the Task: </ins>

The requested task for this assignment was to review the code that was given to us for a mostly completed page - Horiseon - and to refactor any existing code, which means to consolidate and improve the given code without it affecting the current layout of the front-end view of the page. We were asked to make it more accessible not only to a wider potential customer audience but to also make it easier to read for anyone who would be interested in looking at the code itself.

## <ins> Description of the Page: </ins>

What is the purpose of the page? Horiseon is a web-based service provider that aims towards providing assistance in terms of digital media and marketing for any clients looking to boost their standing in the world wide web. Some services include showing up on search engines more frequently, mitigating any negativity that could be lingering pertaining to the client, increasing marketing efficiency and providing leads, and many more services that will in turn boost financial effiency as well in the long run.

## <ins> Installation: </ins>

Installation of the page is very straightforward. All that is required is to download the folder that is provided in the repository and then upload the index.html file along with the assets folder to your website hosting provider.
